<h1>POWERING A CLIMATE SAFER FUTURE</h1>
<p>Focus area:<i>climate change impact awareness</i></p><hr>
<p>Though we often think about<mark> human-induced climate change</mark> as something that will happen in the future, it is an ongoing process. Ecosystems and communities in the India and around the world are being impacted today.</p>

<p>Global temperatures rose about<i> 1.98°F </i>offsite link (1.1°C) from 1901 to 2020, but climate change refers to more than an increase in temperature. It also includes sea level rise, changes in weather patterns like drought and flooding, and much more. Things that we depend upon and value — water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health — are experiencing the effects of a changing climate</p>
<h3>Our changing climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Global temperatures rose about 1.8°F (1°C) from 1901 to 2020</li><br>
<li>Sea level rise has accelerated from 1.7 mm/year throughout most of the twentieth century to 3.2 mm/year since 1993</li><br>
<li>Glaciers are shrinking: average thickness of 30 well-studied glaciers has decreased more than 60 feet since 1980.</li><br>
<li>The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40% since 1979.</li><br>
<li>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 25% since 1958, and by about 40% since the Industrial Revolution.</li><br>
<li>Snow is melting earlier compared to long-term averages</li><br>
</ul>
<h3>The environment</h3>
<p>Climate change will continue to have a significant impact on ecosystems and organisms, though they are not impacted equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as it is warming at least twice the rate of the global average and melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramaticallyoffsite link to sea level rise around the globe.<br><br>Some living things are able to respond to climate change; some plants are blooming earlier and some species may expand their geographic range. But these changes are happening too fast for many other plants and animals as increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns stress ecosystems. Some invasive or nuisance species, like lionfish and ticks, may thrive in even more places because of climate change. <br><br>Changes are also occurring in the ocean. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, the water is becoming more acidic, affecting marine life. Sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion, in addition to melting ice sheets and glaciers, putting coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.<br><br>The compounding effects of climate change are leading to many changes in ecosystems. Coral reefs are vulnerable to many effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching, stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs, and sea level rise can cause corals to be smothered by sediment. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.</p>
